- Custom Fields for Unique Identifiers
- Advanced Category Mapping
- Variable Product Support
- Accurate Structured Data Format
- Auto-sync With Google Merchant Center

- Google Dynamic Remarketing Pixel support

And so many more!

Get pre-configured settings for Google product feed and Facebook product feed with the least effort possible, and start promoting them immediately.

== 🌟 Customized Product Feeds 🌟 ==

Getting pre-made product feed templates is only one aspect of Product Feed Manager.

But you can do so much more with it such as,

- Add additional product data,
- Category mapping with Google's category,
- Advanced filter options to generate feed with selected products,
- Create a custom feed for merchants for which we do have a template.

==🌟 Automate Feed Generation Processs 🌟==

You can also automate the feed generation process whenever you make changes to your store such as,

- Adding a new product, or
- Changing product details, etc

And to do that you can use its scheduled update feature.

== 🌟 Core Features Product Feed Manager For WooCommerce 🌟 ==

Whether you are starting as a **beginner** with little knowledge of marketplaces' feed requirements, or an **advanced user** who wants to customize the feed data, we have you covered.

Following are all the **core features** that we have released over the years,

**👉 Auto-sync with Google Shopping**

You can auto-sync your store products with Google Merchant Shop (Google Shopping).

Set it up so that your generated product feed (product data feed) will automatically be updated and sent to your Google Merchant Shop as per your schedule.

Creating WooCommerce google shopping feed is easier than ever!

You do not need to download and upload the feed for <a href="https://rextheme.com/best-woocommerce-product-feed/google-product-feed/
?utm_source=pfm_repo&utm_medium=google-landing-url&utm_campaign=pfm-repo-to-google-landing" target="_blank">Google Shopping</a> manually.


**👉 Google Category Mapping (Use it for other marketplaces that use Google category mapping)**

Google requires you to set your products under their fixed Category Lists. But changing your own store's categories is not necessary.

- Use the category mapping feature to map your store categories according to Google's.
Your store's categories will still be the same while your products will be placed under the relevant Google category on the product feed.

-  Map product categories for other sites as well (i.e., > *it is not limited to Google Shopping*).

> *Not only does it support 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a merchant-category based on product names.*

**👉 Advanced Custom Filtering**

You can use the smooth filter options to include or exclude the required products of your store from the product feed.

You can filter by **categories**, **tags**, or **apply custom filters** using other attributes.

You also get custom filter options. Generate feed more precisely using new Product Creation Date & Product Last Modified Date conditions for Custom Filter.


**👉 Schedule Auto Update Of the Product Feed**

Any changes you make to product data, you can set a schedule for your product feed to be updated automatically.

You do not need to manually update the product feed every time you make changes to your products.

**👉 Supports Various Product Feed File Types**

With our WooCommerce product feed plugin, create different types of feed files according to your merchant needs.

With selecting your merchant, you can also select what type of feed you want to generate.

Our supported feed type includes:

- **XML** Product feed
- **CSV** Product feed
- **TEXT** Product feed
- **TSV** Product feed
- **RSS** Product feed

**👉 Advanced Custom Fields**

WooCommerce doesn't provide certain fields such as

**Brand, GTIN, UPC, Age-group, Gender**, etc.

However, Many merchant shops require this data.

Hence, the Product Feed Manager for WooCommerce creates these custom fields for you so that you can generate accurate product feeds without any extra coding or plugins.


**👉 Exclusive WooCommerce Variable Product & Variation Options**

If you have variable products in your WooCommerce site, you can easily choose between parent products and variations to show in your feed.

In our WooCommerce product feed plugin, you’ll get these options -

- Include Only Parent Products (without variations)
- Include Variation Name In The Product Title
- Include All Variable Products Variations

You can select the option and include variable products with or without parent products however you want.

**👉 Create A Custom Feed For Any Merchant**

The custom feed option will allow you to create a personalized feed for any marketplace you want.

The custom WooCommerce feed option will help you to -

- Select your preferred feed attributes
- Choose a custom feed type
- Include/Exclude XML header
- Add Wrapper Element
- Add Item Wrapper

**👉 Google Analytics Support**

Add and configure Google Analytics UTM tracking codes to your product URLs. Measure the effectiveness of marketing channels in Google Analytics.

**👉 Track Products With Facebook Pixel**

You can now add Facebook pixel code to your store and track the performance of every product you upload on Facebook Dynamic Shop using this plugin.

With Facebook Pixel, you can track:

- Simple product pages
- Variable product and variations pages
- Category pages
- Search result pages
- Cart page
- Add to cart button
- Thank you page


>  You will get a **reliable support team** to help you out at all times and detailed [documentation](https://rextheme.com/docs/WooCommerce-product-feed/) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYRgnMFQGH8&list=PLelDqLncNWcVoPA7T4eyyfzTF0i_Scbnq).



**👉 Combine Multiple Attributes In The Feed**

You can now merge different attributes in a single attribute, to show in your WooCommerce XML product feed.

*For example, in the **product title**, you can add a brand name to attract your targeted audience without manually changing it.*

Create more descriptive and keyword-rich product titles, to help your products rank higher in search engines and attract more organic traffic to your sites.

==🌟 ACF Support 🌟==
Get [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin's custom fields support in Product Feed Manager For WooCommerce.

You can not only generate feeds but also fetch custom images using ACF to your product feed easily without any hassle.
